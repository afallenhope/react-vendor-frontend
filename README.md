# FKS Vendor -- React edition

This is a web front end for the Second Life LSL vendor I wrote.

It's incomplete but I'm still adding thing slowly.

Initially I didn't want to upload on github because it was pretty outdated but I figured when I have time I can work on it.

I welcome feedback as long as you're not rude about it.

I have build an AuthContext and am aware that I haven't actually implemented it yet, that was because I was tired of having to login over and over. 

Another project that uses the same database as this one, uses a "magic login link"  where I was going to integrate this as well.

Okies. Questions, Comments and Concern just open an issue.
